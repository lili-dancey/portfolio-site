          WiseWallet was a conceptual project created as a solution for users who are looking to save money for a particular goal.
          The design process began by understanding the user, creating user flows and through user testing, the main features and screens of the app were created.

            <h4>User flows</h4>
            <p>
                I chose to create a flow that had two sections to it. The first is the onboarding process. This included a sequence of screens that would follow when a user creates an account. The second is the set of screens with which a user would interact after creating an account or viewing their home, dashboard and spending insights.

            <h4>Low-fidelity wireframes</h4>
            <p>
                Using the user flows, I created preliminary screens for both scenarios.

            <h4>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h4>
            <p>
                The low-fidelity wireframes were adapted to represent a more accurate representation the information and layout without losing focus on colour and styling.

            <h3>Scenario user testing</h3>
            <p>
                To understand user preferences, pain points, and suggestions for improvement. Users were presented with the mid-fidelity wireframes and asked to imagine themselves using the app in two different scenarios. 
            </p>
            <div>
                <h5>Scenario 1</h5>

                    You have logged into your WiseWallet app and would like to view your dashboard and spending insights as well as add an income.

                    <li>Simple and clear layout helps make the user feel trustful of the website.</li>
                    <li>The use of charts makes the information easier to understand.</li>

            <h4>Impact</h4>
            <p>
                Provided insight into how comfortable users feel to use the features required in the scenario as well as monitoring how instinctual they find the user journey mapping, layout and design.                
            </p>
            <h4>Adaptations</h4>
            <p>
                The user testing provided useful insight into how the screens could be adapted in order to obtain optimal results.

                As part of the design brief, user stories were provided. These stories formed the basis of each screen’s content and layout. Using iterative design techniques, the app’s main feature screens were created.

            <h4>Monthly savings</h4>

            <p>
                Designing with finances in mind requires a careful balance between detailed information and simple and concise language and layout. Therefore brand guidelines were imperative to follow. The ideas behind creating this app were carefully considered and as a designer, it is essential that what is portrayed mirrors the initial idea and concept.
