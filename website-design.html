                  WiseWallet was a conceptual project created as a solution for users who are looking to save money for a particular goal.
                  The design process began by understanding the user, creating user flows and through user testing, the main features and screens of the app were created.

                <h4>User flows</h4>
                <p>
                    I chose to create a flow that had two sections to it. The first is the onboarding process. This included a sequence of screens that would follow when a user creates an account. The second is the set of screens with which a user would interact after creating an account or viewing their home, dashboard and spending insights.

                    Using the user flows, I created preliminary screens for both scenarios.

                    The low-fidelity wireframes were adapted to represent a more accurate representation the information and layout without losing focus on colour and styling.

                    To understand user preferences, pain points, and suggestions for improvement. Users were presented with the mid-fidelity wireframes and asked to imagine themselves using the app in two different scenarios.

                <p>
                    Provided insight into how comfortable users feel to use the features required in the scenario as well as monitoring how instinctual they find the user journey mapping, layout and design.

                <p>

                <p>
                    Designing with finances in mind requires a careful balance between detailed information and simple and concise language and layout. Therefore brand guidelines were imperative to follow. The ideas behind creating this app were carefully considered and as a designer, it is essential that what is portrayed mirrors the initial idea and concept.
